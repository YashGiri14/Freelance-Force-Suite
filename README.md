# Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

1. Problem Statement
Freelancers and independent contractors often manage their business using a patchwork of disconnected applications: one for project management (like Trello or Asana), another for proposals (like Google Docs), a separate tool for time tracking, and yet another for invoicing. This fragmented approach leads to several critical issues:

Inefficiency: Manual data entry across platforms is time-consuming and prone to errors.

Lack of Visibility: It's difficult to get a clear, real-time view of project profitability, client lifetime value, or outstanding invoices.

Scalability Issues: As the client base grows, this manual system becomes unmanageable, hindering business growth.

Unprofessionalism: Delayed invoices and a lack of a central client communication log can lead to a poor client experience.

SoloForce OS aims to solve this by creating a unified Salesforce application to manage the entire client and project lifecycle, from lead to final payment.

2. Requirement Gathering
Client Management: A central database for all client information, communication history, and associated projects.

Project & Task Management: Ability to create projects linked to clients, with milestones and individual tasks.

Time Tracking: A simple interface (e.g., a screen flow or LWC) to log billable and non-billable hours against specific tasks or projects.

Invoice Generation: Automated creation of professional PDF invoices from logged billable hours.

Financial Reporting: Dashboards to visualize key metrics like revenue per client, project profitability, and outstanding invoice amounts.

Proposal Management: A system to track the status of proposals sent to potential clients.

3. Stakeholder Analysis
Primary Stakeholder: The Freelancer/Solopreneur.

Needs: An all-in-one system that is easy to use, saves time on administrative tasks, and provides clear insights into their business health. They need to quickly see what needs to be done, how much time they've spent, and who owes them money.

4. Business Process Mapping
As-Is (Current) Process:
A new lead emails the freelancer.

The freelancer manually creates a proposal in Google Docs and emails it.

Once the client agrees, the freelancer sets up a new board in Trello.

Tasks are managed in Trello, and time is logged in a separate app like Clockify or a spreadsheet.

At the end of the month, the freelancer manually calculates hours, creates an invoice in an online tool, and emails it to the client.

Payment is tracked by manually checking the bank account and marking the invoice as paid in the invoicing tool.

To-Be (Future Salesforce) Process:
A lead is captured via a web-to-lead form and an Opportunity is created to track the proposal.

Once the Opportunity is 'Closed Won', a Project record is automatically created from a template.

The freelancer manages Milestones and Tasks directly on the Project record.

Using a custom LWC or screen flow, the freelancer logs Time Log records against tasks.

A flow runs monthly (or on-demand) to aggregate unbilled Time Logs for a project, creating an Invoice record.

An Apex trigger generates a PDF of the invoice and emails it to the client. The invoice status is tracked, and automated reminders are sent for overdue payments.

5. Industry-specific Use Case Analysis
Retainer vs. Project-based Work: The system must be flexible enough to handle both fixed-price projects and monthly retainer agreements. This could be managed with different record types for Projects.

Expense Tracking: Freelancers need to track project-specific expenses (e.g., software licenses, stock photos) to bill back to the client. This would require a custom Expense object linked to Projects.

Profitability Calculation: The ultimate goal is to see profit. A formula field on the Project object could calculate (Total Billed Amount - Total Expenses) to show real-time profitability.

6. AppExchange Exploration
Salesforce Payments: For integrating payment gateways like Stripe directly, allowing clients to pay invoices online.

DocuSign or PandaDoc: For sending proposals and contracts for e-signature directly from Salesforce.

QuickBooks or Xero Connectors: To sync financial data for accounting purposes, reducing double-entry for the freelancer or their accountant.
